## Overview

This challenged took me exactly 8 days of on and off coding to achieve. It is the coding of the landing page for an abstract company called Fylo.

### The challenge

The challenge for this exercise is:

- For users to see the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size.
- To see hover states for all interactive elements on the page.

### Screenshot

Below is the full image of the screenshot of the designed site all done

## My process
I started with writing the html from begining to finish before i started styling with CSS. This is different from the approach most programmers uses by coding both html and CSS simultaneously.

It was however a challenge i was will to try so i did.

### Built with

The website was built using the following

- HTML
- CSS

### What I learned

I learnt the use of several CSS properties in this project. I understood more the use of *display* and how to move elements using the *z-index*

If you want to learn more about  CSS, visit [W3School](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) for all you need to know about CSS, htlm and any other language.


### Continued development

I hope to learn to brush up on the little challenges i face in replicating the UI design. I will definitely be going back to learn more abt CCS and how best to use selectors.

### Useful resources

- [Learn CSS Grid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV8B24rSN5o&t=67s) - This helped me understand more about the use of grid.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
